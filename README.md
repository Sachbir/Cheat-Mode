# Cheat-Mode for Factorio 0.16

This was a project created to manage common console commands through a GUI interface. During experimentation with different styles of gameplay, it helps to be able to change your settings, such as running speed and reach, but also testing realistic conditions such as fighting off biters. This project allowed for easily changing many different settings without having to remember and type in long strings of commands. 

When I first wrote this, the popular Cheat Mode mod was not yet updated for the latest version of the game, so I decided to try my hand at it in the meanwhile, but I ended up enjoying it so much I came to use it over the original, especially because I could tweak it to my needs at any given moment. 

This 'soft mod' offered a few advantages over traditional mods:

1) It is stored in the game's save file, so you do not need to reload the game to apply it
2) It can be loaded server-side without others needing to load it on their clients first
3) It relied heavily on in-game assets, making processing more efficient overall

While there were many things that were lacking (eg. an infinite fluid source), it was a fun project and quite a challenge when I was just starting to program.
